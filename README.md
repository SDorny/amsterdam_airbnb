# Amsterdam - Airbnb vs Destination


This application shows me the Airbnb locations in Amsterdam compared to the place I want to visit. This helps me to decide where the best place is to stay based on the distance from my location and price.
I used NumPy to make modifications to the data in a CSV file. This helped me to learn NumPy and understand its computing capabilites. I also used Google Colab in order to run the lines of code and share with others in the CoRise bootcamp.
Some of the challenges I faced in this project were understanding what I was doing. I've linked below resources that helped me to comprehend matrices and their different dimensions as well as the documentation. This was also my first attempt at using streamlit.
For the future, I want to implement more interaction in the streamlit app, such as slicers by distance and price.

Credits: A huge thank you to CoRise! They are an incredible company who put on a 2.5 week bootcamp to introduce individuals to NumPy and Pandas. This course was taught by Luca Belli, managed by Shreya Vora, and assisted by 5 wonderful TA's.
